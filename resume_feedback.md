# Areas for improvement

## Profile Section

-   While it provides a good overview, it could be more concise. Try to distill it to key points to enhance readability.
-   Remove passive phrases like "I can frequently be found in international fan games, hackathons, and game jams" and replace them with active achievements.

## Bullets

-   Greater consistancy with the smaller tags

## Experience and Project

-   The descriptions are clear but could benefit from **more** quantifiable achievements. For example, "Developed programming curriculum" could be enhanced with specifics like the number of students impacted or improvements in student performance.
-   Excellent detail here, but consider adding specific technologies or tools used in each project for clarity. For instance, specify if Unity or another engine was used for "MOTHERÂ²". Where possible, quantify contributions (e.g., "Contributed to over 35% of the codebase" could include the approximate number of lines or features added).

## Margins

-   How do they print?
